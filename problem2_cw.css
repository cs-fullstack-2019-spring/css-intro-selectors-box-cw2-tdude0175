/*Start with the included HTML file problem2_cw.html. Create an external CSS file called problem2_cw.css and create selectors to style the HTML as follows:

Give the p tags a gray background, and a right margin of 10%.
Make the class "secondParagraph" have a background color of blue, and horizontally centered on the page.
Create selectors to set the background of the first, third, and fourth classes to pink with top and bottom padding of 10px.
Create a selector that styles the text My First Jibberish Post! that sets block properties as follows:
width = 500px height = 100px padding = 10px dashed border = 3px And a setting that will keep the text horizontally centered on the page as the screen is resized*/
